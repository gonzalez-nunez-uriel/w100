MEPHISTOPHELES

Since Thou, O Lord, deign'st to approach again And ask us how we do, in manner kindest, And
heretofore to meet myself wert fain, Among Thy menials, now, my face Thou findest. Pardon, this
troop I cannot follow after With lofty speech, though by them scorned and spurned: My pathos
certainly would move Thy laughter, If Thou hadst not all merriment unlearned. Of suns and worlds
I've nothing to be quoted; How men torment themselves, is all I've noted. The little god o' the
world sticks to the same old way, And is as whimsical as on Creation's day. Life somewhat better
might content him, But for the gleam of heavenly light which Thou hast lent him: He calls it
Reasonâ€”thence his power's increased, To be far beastlier than any beast. Saving Thy Gracious
Presence, he to me A long-legged grasshopper appears to be, That springing flies, and flying
springs, And in the grass the same old ditty sings. Would he still lay among the grass he grows in!
Each bit of dung he seeks, to stick his nose in.


THE LORD

Hast thou, then, nothing more to mention?
Com'st ever, thus, with ill intention?
Find'st nothing right on earth, eternally?


MEPHISTOPHELES

No, Lord! I find things, there, still bad as they can be.
Man's misery even to pity moves my nature;
I've scarce the heart to plague the wretched creature.
