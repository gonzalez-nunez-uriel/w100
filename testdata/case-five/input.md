PART II

I was then in Germany, attracted thither by the wars in
that country, which have not yet been brought to a termination;
and as I was returning to the army from the coronation of the emperor,
the setting in of winter arrested me in a locality where, as I found no
society to interest me, and was besides fortunately undisturbed by any cares or passions,
I remained the whole day in seclusion, with full opportunity to occupy my attention with my own
thoughts. Of these one of the very first that occurred to me was, that there is seldom so much
perfection in works composed of many separate parts, upon which different hands had
been employed, as in those completed by a single master. Thus it is
observable that the buildings which a single architect
has planned and executed, are generally more
elegant and commodious than those
which several have attempted to
improve, by making old
walls serve for
purposes for
which they were not originally built.
Thus also, those ancient cities which,
from being at first only villages, have become,
in course of time, large towns, are usually but ill laid
out compared with the regularity constructed towns which a professional
architect has freely planned on an open plain; so that although the several
buildings of the former may often equal or surpass in beauty those of the latter,
yet when one observes their indiscriminate juxtaposition, there a large one and here a small,
and the consequent crookedness and irregularity of the streets, one is disposed to allege that chance
rather than any human will guided by reason must have led to such an arrangement.
And if we consider that nevertheless there have been at all times certain
officers whose duty it was to see that private buildings contributed to
public ornament, the difficulty of reaching high perfection with but
the materials of others to operate on, will be readily acknowledged.
In the same way I fancied that those nations which, starting
from a semi-barbarous state and advancing to civilization
by slow degrees, have had their laws successively
determined, and, as it were, forced upon
them simply by experience of the
hurtfulness of particular
crimes and disputes,
would by this process come to
be possessed of less perfect institutions than those which,
from the commencement of their association as communities,
have followed the appointments of some wise legislator. It is thus
quite certain that the constitution of the true religion, the ordinances
of which are derived from God, must be incomparably superior to that of
every other. And, to speak of human affairs, I believe that the pre-eminence
of Sparta was due not to the goodness of each of its laws in particular,
for many of these were very strange, and even opposed to good morals,
but to the circumstance that, originated by a single individual, they all tended to a single end.
In the same way I thought that the sciences contained in books (such of them at least as are made up
of probable reasonings, without demonstrations), composed as they are of the opinions of many different
individuals massed together, are farther removed from truth than the simple inferences which a man of good sense
using his natural and unprejudiced judgment draws respecting the matters of his experience. And because we have
all to pass through a state of infancy to manhood, and have been of necessity, for a length of time, governed by
our desires and preceptors (whose dictates were frequently conflicting, while neither perhaps always counseled
us for the best), I farther concluded that it is almost impossible that our judgments can be so correct or
solid as they would have been, had our reason been mature from the moment of our birth,
and had we always been guided by it alone.

It is true, however, that it is not customary to pull down all the houses of a town with the single
design of rebuilding them differently, and thereby rendering the streets more handsome; but it often
happens that a private individual takes down his own with the view of erecting it anew, and that people
are even sometimes constrained to this when their houses are in danger of falling from age, or when
the foundations are insecure. With this before me by way of example, I was persuaded that it would indeed
be preposterous for a private individual to think of reforming a state by fundamentally changing it
throughout, and overturning it in order to set it up amended; and the same I thought was true of any
similar project for reforming the body of the sciences, or the order of teaching them established in the schools:
but as for the opinions which up to that time I had embraced, I thought that I could not do better than
resolve at once to sweep them wholly away, that I might afterwards be in a position to admit either
others more correct, or even perhaps the same when they had undergone the scrutiny of reason. I firmly
believed that in this way I should much better succeed in the conduct of my life, than if I built only
upon old foundations, and leaned upon principles which, in my youth, I had taken upon trust. For although I
recognized various difficulties in this undertaking, these were not, however, without remedy, nor once
to be compared with such as attend the slightest reformation in public affairs. Large bodies, if once
overthrown, are with great difficulty set up again, or even kept erect when once seriously shaken,
and the fall of such is always disastrous. Then if there are any imperfections in the constitutions
of states (and that many such exist the diversity of constitutions is alone sufficient to assure us),
custom has without doubt materially smoothed their inconveniences, and has even managed to steer
altogether clear of, or insensibly corrected a number which sagacity could not have provided against
with equal effect; and, in fine, the defects are almost always more tolerable than the change necessary
for their removal; in the same manner that highways which wind among mountains, by being much frequented,
become gradually so smooth and commodious, that it is much better to follow them than to seek a straighter
path by climbing over the tops of rocks and descending to the bottoms of precipices.

Hence it is that I cannot in any degree approve of those restless and busy meddlers who,
called neither by birth nor fortune to take part in the management of public affairs,
are yet always projecting reforms;
and if I thought that this tract contained aught which might justify
the suspicion that I was a victim of such folly,
I would by no means permit its publication.
I have never contemplated anything higher than the reformation of my own opinions,
and basing them on a foundation wholly my own.
And although my own satisfaction with my work has led me to present here a draft of it,
I do not by any means therefore recommend to every one else to make a similar attempt.
Those whom God has endowed with a larger measure of genius will entertain, perhaps, designs still more exalted;
but for the many I am much afraid lest even the present undertaking be more than they can safely venture to imitate.
The single design to strip oneâ€™s self of all past beliefs is one that ought not to be taken by every one.
The majority of men is composed of two classes, for neither of which would this be at all a befitting resolution:
in the first place, of those who with more than a due confidence in their own powers, are precipitate
in their judgments and want the patience requisite for orderly and circumspect thinking;
whence it happens, that if men of this class once take the liberty to doubt of their accustomed
opinions, and quit the beaten highway, they will never be able to thread the byway that would lead
them by a shorter course, and will lose themselves and continue to wander for life; in the second
place, of those who, possessed of sufficient sense or modesty to determine that there are others
who excel them in the power of discriminating between truth and error,
and by whom they may be instructed, ought rather to content themselves with the opinions of such than trust for more correct to their own reason.

For my own part, I should doubtless have belonged to the latter class,
had I received instruction from but one master, or had I never known the diversities of opinion
that from time immemorial have prevailed among men of the greatest learning. But I had become aware, even
so early as during my college life, that no opinion, however
absurd and incredible, can be imagined, which has not been maintained by some on of the philosophers; and afterwards in the course of my travels I remarked that all those whose opinions are decidedly repugnant to ours are not in that account barbarians and savages, but on the contrary that many of these nations make an
equally good, if not better, use of their reason than we do. I took into account also the very different character which a person brought up from infancy in France or Germany exhibits,
from that which, with the same mind originally, this individual would have possessed had he lived
always among the Chinese or with savages, and the circumstance that in dress itself the fashion
which pleased us ten years ago, and which may again, perhaps, be received into favor before ten
years have gone, appears to us at this moment extravagant and ridiculous. I was thus led to infer
that the ground of our opinions is far more custom and example than any certain knowledge. And,
finally, although such be the ground of our opinions, I remarked that a plurality of suffrages is no
guarantee of truth where it is at all of difficult discovery, as in such cases it is much more
likely that it will be found by one than by many. I could, however, select from the crowd no one
whose opinions seemed worthy of preference, and thus I found myself constrained, as it were, to use
my own reason in the conduct of my life.

But like one walking alone and in the dark,
I resolved to proceed so slowly and with such circumspection, that if I did not advance far, I would
at least guard against falling. I did not even choose to dismiss summarily any of the opinions that
had crept into my belief without having been introduced by reason, but first of all took sufficient
time carefully to satisfy myself of the general nature of the task I was setting myself, and ascertain
the true method by which to arrive at the knowledge of whatever lay within the compass of my powers.
